# 📧 Spam Classifier

This project is a **Spam Classifier** built using machine learning techniques in Python. It classifies SMS or email text messages as **spam** or **ham (not spam)** based on their content.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal)
- Vectorization using TF-IDF
- Machine learning classification (e.g., Naive Bayes or SVM)
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
- Easily extendable for web or API deployment

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- NumPy
- NLTK / spaCy (for NLP tasks)
- Jupyter Notebook or Streamlit (optional for UI)

---

## 🧠 Model Training

1. Preprocess the data (cleaning, tokenization, vectorization)
2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets
3. Train the model using a supervised algorithm (e.g., Multinomial Naive Bayes)
4. Evaluate and tune using validation metrics
